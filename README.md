# Global-Disaster-Response-Analysis-2018-2024-
This dataset captures global disaster events reported between 2018 and 2024, including details on disaster types, affected countries, severity, casualties, and economic impact.The dataset enables analysis of disaster management and the relationship between disaster intensity, response quality, and recovery duration across different regions.

# Overview

This project analyzes global disaster response data from 2018 to 2024 to evaluate how response efficiency influences recovery duration, human casualties, and economic losses.
All data preparation, analysis, and visualization were performed exclusively using Microsoft Excel.

## Objectives

Assess the relationship between response time and recovery duration

Examine the impact of disaster severity on human casualties

Analyze the correlation between aid allocation and economic losses

Identify disaster types with the highest overall impact.

## Dataset

The dataset contains global disaster records with variables including:

Disaster type

Year and location

Severity index

Human impact metrics

Economic losses

Aid allocation

Response time

Recovery duration


### Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Pivot tables and charts

Descriptive statistics

### Methodology

Cleaned and standardized raw disaster data

Conducted exploratory data analysis using pivot tables

Visualized trends and insights with Excel charts


## Objective Question 1 — Disaster Patterns
Which disaster types occur most frequently, and how do their occurrences vary across countries and over time (2018–2024)?
Why it matters:Identifies priority disaster types and high-risk regions.

## Objective Question 2 — Human Impact
Which countries experience the highest human impact in terms of casualties?
Why it matters:Shows where disasters are most deadly.

## Objective Question 3 — Economic Impact & Funding
Do disaster types with higher economic losses receive proportionate levels of aid, or are there systematic funding gaps?
Why it matters:Evaluates fairness and efficiency of disaster aid allocation.

## Objective Question 4 — Response Performance
How does response time and response efficiency vary across disaster types and regions?
Why it matters:Measures operational effectiveness of disaster management systems.


### OBSERVATIONS.

1. Landslide is the ost frequent disaster over the years, their occurence varies accross the countries over 2018-2024.

2. Brazil is the country that recorded highest number of casualties, brazil also top the chart of  High and Extreme severity grade categories. however,,Turkey top the chart of the Medium severity grade while Brazil also top the chart of Low severity grade categories. this simply means the number of casualties does not depend on the severity index of each countries.

3. There is obviously a wide funding gap as  all disasters recieves a far less than 10 percent in aid amount.

4. Volcanic eruptions receive the fastest average response times, likely due to improved monitoring and early-warning systems.
Floods experience the slowest response times, reflecting their wide geographic spread and logistical challenges.
Tornadoes exhibit a response–recovery mismatch: despite relatively efficient response, recovery periods remain long due to infrastructure damage.


#### Key Findings

Faster response times are generally associated with shorter recovery durations

Higher disaster severity leads to increased casualties and economic losses

Aid allocation does not always scale proportionally with economic impact
