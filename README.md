# Global-Disaster-Response-Analysis-2018-2024-
This dataset captures global disaster events reported between 2018 and 2024, including details on disaster types, affected countries, severity, casualties, and economic impact.The dataset enables analysis of disaster management and the relationship between disaster intensity, response quality, and recovery duration across different regions.
# Overview

This project analyzes global disaster response data from 2018 to 2024 to evaluate how response efficiency influences recovery duration, human casualties, and economic losses.
All data preparation, analysis, and visualization were performed exclusively using Microsoft Excel.

## Objectives

Assess the relationship between response time and recovery duration

Examine the impact of disaster severity on human casualties

Analyze the correlation between aid allocation and economic losses

Identify disaster types with the highest overall impact.

## Dataset

The dataset contains global disaster records with variables including:

Disaster type

Year and location

Severity index

Human impact metrics

Economic losses

Aid allocation

Response time

Recovery duration


### Tools Used

Microsoft Excel

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Pivot tables and charts

Descriptive statistics

### Methodology

Cleaned and standardized raw disaster data

Conducted exploratory data analysis using pivot tables

Visualized trends and insights with Excel charts

#### Key Findings

Faster response times are generally associated with shorter recovery durations

Higher disaster severity leads to increased casualties and economic losses

Aid allocation does not always scale proportionally with economic impact
